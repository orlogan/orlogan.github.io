<p>Many of the worlds smartest people have spent their entire lives trying to define truth. Definitions range from â€œjustified, true beliefâ€ to â€œeverythingâ€™s, like, relative manâ€ and everything in between. It seems fruitless to join in on the conversation, so mathematicians did what they are best at. They decided to be lazy.</p>

<h3 id="propositions-a-game-of-symbols">Propositions: A Game of Symbols</h3>

<p>When we talk about propositions, what we mean are statements that are either true or false. For example, â€œGravity pull me towards the earthâ€ and â€œgreen is a colorâ€ are propositional statements as they are either true or false. But, â€œHow are you?â€ and â€œGet over here!â€ are not propositions. If someone asked how you were doing and you responded â€œyes, I agreeâ€, people would probably avoid you.</p>

<p>When we talk about propositions in general, we usually use the letters p and q. This behaves in the same way we use x and y in algebra or calculus.</p>

<p>Now that we have all of the definitions out of the way, letâ€™s look at exactly how mathematicians used their laziness to avoid the hard question.</p>

<h3 id="logical-connectives">Logical Connectives</h3>

<p>Suppose p and q are propositional statements. You can imagine them as â€œToday is Tuesdayâ€ and â€œIâ€™m wearing pink slippersâ€, or any other propositional statement. We can easily figure out the truth value of p or the truth value of q, if you are using my examples just look at the calendar and your feet. But how do we decide if p AND q are true? Well, we use a truth table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">\(p\)</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">\(q\)</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">\(p \land q\)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">T</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">T</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">T</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">F</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">F</td>
