## Mathematical Truth

Many of the worlds smartest people have spent their entire lives trying to define truth. Definitions range from "justified, true belief" to "everything's, like, relative man" and everything in between. It seems fruitless to join in on the conversation, so mathematicians did what they are best at. They decided to be lazy.

### Propositions: A Game of Symbols

When we talk about propositions, what we mean are statements that are either true or false. For example, "Gravity pull me towards the earth" and "green is a color" are propositional statements as they are either true or false. But, "How are you?" and "Get over here!" are not propositions. If someone asked how you were doing and you responded "yes, I agree", people would probably avoid you. 

When we talk about propositions in general, we usually use the letters p and q. This behaves in the same way we use x and y in algebra or calculus.

Now that we have all of the definitions out of the way, let's look at exactly how mathematicians used their laziness to avoid the hard question.

### Logical Connectives

Suppose p and q are propositional statements. You can imagine them as "Today is Tuesday" and "I'm wearing pink slippers", or any other propositional statement. We can easily figure out the truth value of p or the truth value of q, if you are using my examples just look at the calendar and your feet. But how do we decide if p AND q are true? Well, we use a truth table. 

| $$ p $$ | $$ q $$ | $$ p \land q $$ |
